Woody Allen has played many implausible characters in his career: 
a human sperm, a failed writer, an aging nebbish who remains irresistibly 
attractive to gorgeous Barnard students. Yet none is as preposterous 
as the one that he assumes, by voice and persona, in the new and critically 
acclaimed animated feature, ``Antz.'' Allen plays Z, a whiny, disgruntled 
worker ant who digs dirt and falls in love with Bala, a whiny, disgruntled 
princess ant played by Sharon Stone. Z's best friend is Weaver, a 
hypertrophic soldier ant, played by that he-man's he-haw man, Sylvester 
Stallone. Weaver's boss, and Bala's fiance, is the tyrannical General 
Mandible, who has the voice of Gene Hackman and the eternal jaw of 
George C. ``Patton'' Scott. General Mandible barks to his soldiers, 
``Men, let's move it!'' and ``Gentlemen, now you can see how dangerous 
individualism is!'' ``Antz'' is a cute movie. It is a visually dazzling 
movie. It has some amusing, ant-appropriate lines in it, like when 
Z complains to his therapist about having been neglected by his parents; 
but what else can you expect, he sighs, when you are ``the middle 
child in a family of 5 million?'' Nevertheless, any viewer who knows 
about ants cannot help but feel disgruntled, a case of rantz in the 
pantz. Let's start with the movie's ad line: ``Every ant has HIS day'' 
(emphasis added). If there is any group of creatures in the animal 
kingdom for which that possessive pronoun is inappropriate and unjust, 
it is ants. You might as well say ``Every nun has his day'' or ``Every 
mythical one-breasted Amazon warrior has his day.'' Edward O. Wilson 
of Harvard University, a leading authority on ants, estimates that 
a million billion ants are alive in the world today. The sum biomass 
of ants, he says, weighs four times as much as birds, amphibians, 
reptiles and mammals combined. And that staggering ant biomass is 
almost exclusively female. If you could examine each of the earth's 
million billion ants, you would almost surely fail to find an example 
of a Woody Worker or a Sly Soldier. You would not find a male ant 
that digs dirt, cuts leaves, lugs sandwich crumbs back to the nest, 
or takes on invading termites, as General Mandible's troops do with 
unmistakably androgenic roars. Instead, nearly every task that is 
performed in an ant colony is performed by females. They build the 
nest, they defend the nest, they tend the larvae to insure a continuous 
supply of female labor. Male ants almost do not exist. In the average 
colony, they account for less than one percent of the population, 
and those that exist live very brief lives. So what do these rare 
specimens do? To get an idea, think back to Allen's literally seminal 
role in ``Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex.'' Male ants subsist 
solely to inseminate the queen during her so-called nuptial flight, 
when she flies out of her nest in search of sperm. The males are there 
to greet her, and she mates with one or more, storing their contributions 
internally to use as needed. ``Males are really just bags of sperm,'' 
said Kenneth Ross, an entomologist at the University of Georgia in 
Athens. They are non-refillable bags, alas, and they do not store 
well. ``With almost no exception, males die immediately after mating,'' 
said Ross. ``If they haven't mated by the time winter comes, they 
are cannibalized by the workers.'' The same principle of female dominance 
applies to the other famously social insects, the honeybees. In their 
case, scientists have given the males a wonderfully evocative name, 
drones. Honeybee drones do not work, and they do not overwinter. Among 
ants and bees, the overwhelming majority of the females are sterile. 
They do not breed, but instead live to serve the queen and the tribe, 
each in her specialized fashion. Colonies of ants and bees have been 
called superorganisms because the individuals act with such a high 
degree of coordination and interdependence that they might as well 
be cells of the body. Behind that willingness to sacrifice self for 
the whole is an unusually high degree of genetic relatedness. For 
most animals, including humans, siblings share about 50 percent of 
their genes. Among ants and bees, by contrast, the sister workers 
in a colony are, on average, 75 percent related to each other, the 
result of a complex system of genetic inheritance given the appropriately 
thick name of haplodiploidy. That shared legacy encourages each worker 
to behave as though the ants to each side of her are practically as 
valuable as she is. And that state of group-think in turn helps explain 
why ants are, as Wilson has written, ``the dominant little-sized organisms 
of the planet.'' The catch for the males is that they do not share 
and fare alike. Male ants (and bees) have only half the number of 
chromosomes seen in the females. As a result, they are much less closely 
related to their female peers than the workers are to each other. 
A male cannot depend on the unshakable bonds of close kinship to save 
his chitin. His hope rests in the queen's nuptial flight, when she 
emerges to gather semen. His hope is that she chooses him and his. 
So maybe a male ant does have his day _ but that day will be his last. 
Note to Z: Stop whining, keep digging and dress in drag.
